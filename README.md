Key Observations :

Data Engineers command the highest upper salary limits

Data Analysts have the lowest ceiling, but also more stable pay

Data Scientists show the widest salary dispersion, signaling skill-based differentiation

Compensation Risks

⚠ Salary compression risk in Data Analyst roles

⚠ Retention risk for senior Data Engineers in mid-sized firms

⚠ Overpayment risk where role scope ≠ pay band

Delaware is an extreme outlier (likely executive/senior niche roles)

Mid-US states show unexpectedly wide ranges, suggesting:

Skill scarcity

Aggressive hiring for select roles
